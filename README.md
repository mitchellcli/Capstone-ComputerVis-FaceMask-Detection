# Capstone-ComputerVis-FaceMask-Detection

## Objective
As countries open up, ontop of preventing the spread of the virus due to negligence of wearing masks, different people have different comfort levels on exposure to others with and without masks in public places like the gym that brian alluded to. One of those dependencies  are how other's follow mask policies. So to add a layer of transparency and accountability on how certain location's enforce their mask policies we created a model that is able to detect from a video feed if someone is wearing a face mask, and the type of mask that they are wearing (for example medical, non medical, or faceshield).

From there, we are able to provide a compliance score per frame throughout the video - we also added the capability to track unique people throughout the video as well, so we can track a particular person's mask tendency throughout the video. . Although this does not enforce compliance, it is a way to provide transparency to customers and allow for surveillance of risk at an individual level.
